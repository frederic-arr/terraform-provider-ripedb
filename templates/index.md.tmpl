# RIPE DB Provider

{{ .Description | trimspace }}

## Example Usage

{{ tffile (printf "examples/provider/provider.tf")}}

## Authentication

The RIPE DB provider supports three authentication protocols:

- Anonymous authentication
- Basic authentication (Username/Password/API Key)
- X.509 Client Certificate authentication

### Anonymous Authentication

{{ tffile (printf "examples/provider/auth_anonymous.tf")}}

### API Key Authentication

API key authentication allows you to edit the objects maintained by the authenticated maintainer.

To configure `API Key` authentication generate an API key as per [Appendix K - API Keys](https://docs.db.ripe.net/Appendices/Appendix-K--API-Keys).

### X.509 Client Certificate Authentication

X.509 client certificate authentication provides the same capabilites as the API key authentication, the only difference is the authentication protocol.

To configure `X.509` authentication generate a client certificate as per [Appendix I - Client Certificate Authentication](https://docs.db.ripe.net/Appendices/Appendix-I--Client-Certificate-Authentication/) and add the certificate to the maintainer's authentication methods.

### Username/Password Authentication

> **DEPRECIATION NOTICE**: RIPE NCC is deprecating MD5 hashed passwords by the end of 2025.

Username/Password authentication provides the same capabilites as the API key authentication, the only difference is the authentication protocol.

You can configure an MD5 password on the maintainer and then specify the maintainer name (ending with `-MNT` as the maintainer) as the user use the configured password.

> **CAUTION**: It is possible to provider the password without the username, but it is not recommended.
> This will pass the password as a query parameter in the URL (instead of the `Authorization` header).
