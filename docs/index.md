# RIPE DB Provider

The RIPE DB provider is used to interact with the objects in the RIPE database. The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before objects can be modified.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "ripe" {}

data "ripedb_object" "mntner_ripe" {
  class = "mntner"
  value = "RIPE-MNT"
}
```

## Authentication

The RIPE DB provider supports three authentication protocols:

- Anonymous authentication
- Basic authentication (Username/Password/API Key)
- X.509 Client Certificate authentication

### Anonymous Authentication

```terraform
provider "ripe" {}
```

### Basic Authentication

Basic authentication allows you to edit the objects maintained by the authenticated maintainer.

You can either configure an MD5 password on the maintainer and then specify the maintainer name (ending with `-MNT` as the maintainer) as the user use the configured password.

> **CAUTION**: It is possible to provider the password without the username, but it is not recommended.
> This will pass the password as a query parameter in the URL (instead of the `Authorization` header).

It is also possible to use an API key, please refer to [RIPE's documentation - Appendix K - API Keys](https://docs.db.ripe.net/23.Appendices/11-Appendix-K--API-Keys.html)

```terraform
provider "ripe" {
  user     = var.user
  password = var.password
}
```

### X.509 Client Certificate Authentication

X.509 client certificate authentication provides the same capabilites as the Basic authentication, the only difference is the authentication protocol.

To configure `X.509` authentication generate a client certificate as per [Appendix I - Client Certificate Authentication](https://docs.db.ripe.net/Appendices/Appendix-I--Client-Certificate-Authentication/) and add the certificate to the maintainer's authentication methods.

```terraform
provider "ripe" {
  certificate = file("$PATH_TO/cert.pem")
  key         = file("$PATH_TO/key.pem")
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `certificate` (String, Sensitive) PEM-encoded client certificate for TLS authentication. Both `certificate` and `key` must be provided. The `endpoint` field must be set appropriately if you are not using the default production API. You cannot use X.509 Client Authentication and Basic authentication at the same time.
- `database` (String) The database where the queries should be made. This is equivalent to the `source` field of the objects.
- `endpoint` (String) The endpoint of the RIPE Database RESTful API.
- `key` (String, Sensitive) PEM-encoded client certificate key for TLS authentication. Both `certificate` and `key` must be provided. The `endpoint` field must be set appropriately if you are not using the default production API. You cannot use X.509 Client Authentication and Basic authentication at the same time.
- `password` (String, Sensitive) Password for the basic authentication protocol. If no `user` is provided, the authentication will be made through the `password` query parameter instead of the `Authorizatio` header. You cannot use X.509 Client Authentication and Basic authentication at the same time.
- `user` (String) Username for the basic authentication protocol. You cannot use X.509 Client Authentication and Basic authentication at the same time.
